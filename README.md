This project aims to complement the built-in TFS controls with commonly requested controls.

This project has been transitioned to GitHub from its orignal home on Codeplex https://witcustomcontrols.codeplex.com/. 

With the updated release cadence of Visual Studio, we plan to actively develop for v.Current and v.Next (as previews become available). The Codeplex project will remain for the foreseeable future but all 2013 and future dev will happen here.

For documentation on using the activities please see the Wiki on this project https://github.com/tfswitextensions/CustomControls/wiki
